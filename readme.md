# PodLink Autocomplete for Alfred

PodLink generates a free landing page for every podcast to help listeners find shows in their favorite podcast app. This Alfred workflow brings the PodLink autocomplete straight to your launcher. [Alfred Powerpack](https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/) is required to run Alfred Workflows.

## Installation

    - rss
3. Invoke the workflow by typing the keyword `pod` followed by your search.
4. Results will appear including the artwork, title, and publisher.
5. Select a result to open the PodLink page in your browser.
6. Alternatively, hold down `command` while selecting a result to directly open the show with your favorite player.
