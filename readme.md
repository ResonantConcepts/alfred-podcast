# Podcast Search Suggestions for Alfred
This workflow lets you search for a podcast with search suggestions (powered by [PodLink](https://pod.link/)) right from your Alfred launcher.

## Installation
**<a download href="https://github.com/ResonantConcepts/alfred-podcast/releases/latest/download/podlink-alfred.alfredworkflow">Download and install the latest release</a>** 

_You will need the [Powerpack](https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/) to enable this workflow._

## Basic Usage
1. Invoke Alfred and type the keyword `pod` followed by your query. Results, including the artwork and title of the podcast, will populate below.
2. Press <kbd>Return</kbd> to open the selected result in your default browser.
3. Press <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to copy the URL of the selected result to your clipboard.

## Advanced Usage
If you prefer to open a link directly to a specific platform, you can specify a keyword before your query, such as `pod overcast accidental`, to open the results in that platform. Supported keywords includes:
- apple
- breaker
- bullhorn
- castbox
- castro
- google
- listennotes
- overcast
- playerfm
- pocketcasts
- podbean
- podcastaddict
- podcastguru
- podchaser
- podhero
- podknife
- podnews
- radiopublic
- spotify
- stitcher
- rss

## Known Issues
PodLink sources results from the Apple Podcasts directory. If a podcast is not listed there, it will not appear in search results.

Not all podcasts are necessarily available on all platforms. For example, `pod spotify exponent` isn't on Spotify, but Exponent will still appear in the search results. If PodLink cannot find a match on an platform, the link will redirect back to the PodLink page for that podcast.
