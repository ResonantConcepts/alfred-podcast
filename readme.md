# PodLink Autocomplete for Alfred
PodLink generates a free landing page for every podcast to help listeners find shows in their favorite podcast app. This Alfred workflow brings the PodLink autocomplete straight to your launcher. [Alfred Powerpack](https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/) is required to run Alfred Workflows.

4. Select a result and hit <kbd>⏎</kbd> to open the PodLink page in your browser.
